<h2 style="color:ivory"><i><p>The lion (Panthera leo) is widely known as the "King of the Jungle," though this title is more symbolic than literal—lions do not actually live in jungles, but rather in savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands of Africa and a small region in northwest India. Despite this, lions have earned the royal title due to their commanding presence, majestic appearance (notably the male’s mane), and their reputation for power and dominance</p></i></h2>

<h2 style="color:ivory"><i><p>Deer are hoofed mammals belonging to the family Cervidae. They are found in a wide range of habitats, including forests, grasslands, mountains, and even urban areas across Europe, Asia, the Americas, and parts of Africa. Most deer species are known for their graceful, slender bodies, long legs, and, in many cases, for the antlers that males develop and shed each year. Female deer, called does, typically do not have antlers (except in reindeer/caribou, where both sexes have them). Deer are herbivores, feeding on leaves, shoots, fruits, and grasses.</p></i></h2>
